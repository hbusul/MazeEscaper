# MazeEscaper
This is a game written in jack language for nand2tetris course. You try to escape from the maze by reaching to circle. 
In the Jack language there is no random function, I used Linear congruential generator to create RNG.
First key user pressed is used as the seed for the RNG. Maze creation algorithm is Recursive Backtracking which is described at
